Please note: It's suggested to not violate the Terms & Conditions of imdb.com  (or any website) and it's best practice to respect the site's robots.txt. 

Public domain information (movie names, ratings, gross income, etc), as I understand it, can be used. 

What we are doing here is using this code for educational purpose only, i do not recomend that you use this data without their permission. I have programmed this code just to show you, how you can pull the data and you have the data in nicer form, which you can extend to any other service.

## What does it do?
It pulls the number of records which you feed in, from a specific link.

## It's not working!
Well you got to install all the dependencies(dependencies.txt), and run it in a python console

#### You can use it by executing step by step or all at once, in a python console or any python IDE.
